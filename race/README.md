## Note about code-style

I hate C# enormous stupid code-style, life is pain. 
I opinionated use Java code-style. 
So most of source files annotated with next:
```csharp
// ReSharper disable InconsistentNaming
```
We can discuss this decision later somehow. 
For now I can say that code-style is not about OOP at all.
